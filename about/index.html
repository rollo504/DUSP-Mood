        <h1>Welcome to Where Y’at, a digital mood ring for MIT’s Department of Urban Studies and Planning. The purpose of this site is to represent the temperature of the department's current state of affairs as perceived by its student body. Through student-led participation we hope to create a space where people can quickly and anonymously share their general feeling of how things are currently - visually representing that mood through this site where as feedback is collected the overall atmosphere will shift. Green means good, yellow means pause, and red means something needs to change. We hope that this active feedback process will help the department heads to quickly gather a general understanding of the overall temperament of its student body, and begin to take steps in finding ways to better meet students where they are.</h1>
