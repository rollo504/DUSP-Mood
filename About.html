        <h1>Welcome to Where Y’at — a digital mood ring for MIT’s Department of Urban Studies and Planning. This site reflects the current climate of the department as perceived by its community. Through student-led participation, we aim to create a space where individuals can quickly and anonymously share how they’re feeling — offering a general pulse-check on the department’s atmosphere. As feedback is collected, the site’s visual environment will shift to represent the collective mood: green means things are good, yellow signals the need to pause and reflect, and red indicates that something needs to change. We hope this ongoing feedback loop helps department leadership stay attuned to the evolving needs of students and take meaningful steps toward support and accountability.</h1>
